- users in the same cluster would be recommend based on an average of other users in the cluster. Not very personalized for user near the edge of the cluster

# Collaborative Filtering 
- user-user collaborative filtering: used to predict the items a user might like based on the ratings given to items by other users who have similar tests 
- item-item collaborative filtering: used to predict the items that user likes based on finding similarites between items that the user had rated and the target item

# Matrix factorization 
- extract hidden features - latent features through Singular Value Decomposition

# Similarity Measures 
- Cosine Similarity, good with sparse data
